Morse Code is a method of transmitting natural langauge text originally developed for tele- graph communication. It was invented back in the 19 century by the inventor of telegraph Sameul F. B. Morse. The current International Morse Code system encodes a range of charac- ters, including the ISO basic Latin alphabets (A–Z), some additional Latin letter representing accents, the Arabic numerals (0–9), and a small set of punctuations and procedural signals (known as prosigns). Each character is presented in Morse Code as an unique sequence of ‘dot’ (.) and ‘dashes’ (_). Each character is separated by a single space, and each word is separated by three spaces.  we are going to define a different set of representation for the Morse Code by using the binary digits. The ‘dots’ are represented by the digit 0 and the ‘dashes’ are represented by the digit 1. As for the spaces, they are represented by the character *. Note that our representation of Morse Code encodes only the standard 26 letters (i.e. ‘A’ to ‘Z’) and the 10 numerals (i.e. ‘0’ to ‘9’).
